The current offering of the Java codec is in this repository as a NetBeans 6.1 project.  Before it is released, it will also be available to be built with an Ant script, so no special IDE will be needed to rebuild it.

Bear in mind also that you don't ever need to rebuild the Java code unless you are changing the codec: there is a downloadable Jar with everything built ready to use.
